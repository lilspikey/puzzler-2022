optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

### Interactive use

`./wordle` can be run to play a game of wordle interactively.

```
./wordle

>nicks
2 ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©

5 â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
>pints

```

### Automatic use

`./wordle` can also be run in "automatic" mode where it will generate a random word then attempt to solve it.

```
$ ./wordle --guesser automatic
cares
1 â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ponty
2 â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©
bingy
3 ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©
bunjy
4 ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©
bundy
5 ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©
bunny
6 ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Automatic mode uses the results to narrow down the list of words after each guess, which _usually_ results in being able to guess the 
word within 6 guesses.  Though not consistently.

#### Benchmark of automatic use

There are 3 different "choosers" for automatic mode. These are used to select the next guess from the current list of available words.

```
# pure random selection
$ ./wordle --guesser automatic --chooser random --benchmark 12972
10951/12972 (84.4%) found - average guess num 4.627157337229477

# pick a word that seems to overlap with the most other words (by at least one letter)
# also has a bias against repeated letters in a word
$ ./wordle --guesser automatic --chooser overlap --benchmark 12972
11495/12972 (88.6%) found - average guess num 4.338321009134407

# attempt to use probability to estimate how likely a word will at least match
# one or more letter/position
$ ./wordle --guesser automatic --chooser likelihood --benchmark 12972
11376/12972 (87.7%) found - average guess num 4.372802390998594
```
